#### âš¡ Monitor forever.js processes <br>

## About

`this.tool` is here to help you monitor and **automate your server processes**.



If you're like me and run many bots/scripts as daemons, you probably came across the **forever.js tool**.

This tool is âœ¨ **AMAZING** âœ¨ and I use it basically for everything that needs to be run without my consent.

After some weird crashes, I noticed a weakness in the way I run my bots.. they don't automatically start themselves after crashing ðŸ˜¨.



This is why I wrote this little script. It checks if a bot/script is running, if not it tries to spin up a new instance. 

Feel free to use it and contribute if you have good ideas on how to make it better, thanks and bye ðŸ‘‹



## Usage

At first, make sure you have *forever* installed. If not, please checkout the *[forever github](https://github.com/foreversd/forever)* page and install the program. 



1. Modify the *settings.json* file; add the jobs you want to monitor
2. Run the script: `python3 run_forever_proc.py`
3. Done! ðŸŽ‰



See, it's that easy :) <br>

To make sure everything is running as expected, you can check the *log file(s)* for either the forever process (*normally located in: `~/.forever/NAME.log`*) or the produced *log file* from the **script** (*normally located in: `~/forever_proc.log`*).
